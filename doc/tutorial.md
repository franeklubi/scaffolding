Alright, You decided to embark on the adventure of learning how to use **scaffolding**!

I couldn't be more sorry for You!


# Introduction

I recommend opening the [list of opcodes](./opcodes.md), You'll need it for reference.

In this tutorial I'll analyse and explain a couple of programs written in scaf.

Before that, let's lay down some fundamentals first:
- The **Read Head** (blue) and the **Write Head** (red) both initially start at position (0, 0).
- The **Read Head** advances automatically until it reaches an illegal position (outside the buffer).
- **Current Head** points to the **Write Head** by default.
- If You instruct the **Write Head** to go out of bounds, it will expand the buffer, so that it's position is always legal.


# [absolute.scaf](../sample_programs/absolute.scaf)

```scaf
9y9+9xY.O. .D.U.D.E.
```

This short script does two things:
1. Positions the **Write Head** on the 9th line and 18 column:
    1. Loads `9` into the **Write Head**'s **mod**.
    2. Executes opcode `y`.
    3. Loads `9`, then adds another `9` to **mod**.
    4. Executes opcode `x`.

2. Loads 7 chars and prints them sequentially until it reaches the end of the buffer:
    1. Loads a char into the **Write Head**'s **mod**.
    2. Executes opcode `.`.
    3. Repeats that 7 times.

# [loop.scaf](../sample_programs/loop.scaf)

```scaf
a.b.07<
```

This bane of a script will never terminate.

1. First loop:
    1. Starts with loading and printing first `a`, then `b`.
    2. Loads `0` (which is totally useless), then `7`.
    3. Executes opcode `<` whereby the whole buffer shifts.

2. Subsequent loops:
    1. Loads `b`, then again `b` and prints it. The double `b` is a prominent example of the script overwriting the previous code.
    2. Executes opcode `<` after loading in `0`, then `7`.
